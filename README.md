This is the HTML/JS for http://ismyfishkosher.com. 

If you've ever tried to figure out whether a particular fish is kosher by searching the web, you know that this isn't a straightforward exercise. Indeed, the current sites I've seen just have long lists of fish names, and you end up scrolling through those lists (on your smartphone), or you have to ctrl-f your way to the answer.

I got annoyed - and built the simplest thing I could think of. A site that allows you to type in the name of a fish and, in real time, tells you whether that fish is kosher or not. My coverage of the various fish is pretty descent, but it's continuously evolving.
